1. Define a Pydantic model(class) that represents the ideal schema of the data
    - This includes the expected fields, their types,and any validation constraints (e.g. gt=0 for positive numbers).
2. Instantiate the model with raw input data (usually a dictionary or JSON-like structure).
    - Pydantic will automatically validate the data and coerce it into the correct Python types (if possible).
    - If the data doesn't meet the model's requirements. Pydantic raises a ValidateError.
3. Pass the validated model object to functions or use it throughout your codebase.
    - This ensures that every part of your program works with clean,type-safe,and logically valid data.
